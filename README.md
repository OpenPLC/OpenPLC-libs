OpenPLC
========

* OpenPLC is an effort to implement a robust and industry standard PLC
(Programmable Logic Controller) keeping in the spirit of Open Source 
Hardware (OSHW) and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). OpenPLC builds
upon the Arduino platform.

* For more details on OpenPLC visit the website http://openplcproject.com

* Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free.

Usage
------------
You can copy this hardware folder to your sketchbook to add support for OpenPLC boards.
As of now (Sept, 2014), there is basic support for writing sketches for OpenPLC main boards.
In future OpenPLC Mini boards shall be added too.
